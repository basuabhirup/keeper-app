## Objective of this Project
* To build a custom keeper app from the starting files

## Steps I have followed:
1. Downloaded the starting files and installed the requiring dependencies using `npm install` command.
2. Created 4 components - `App`, `Header`, `Note` & `Footer` and edited them accordingly to render the corresponding elements in `ReactDOM`.
