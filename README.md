## Objective of this Project
* To build a custom keeper app from the starting files

## Steps I have followed:
1. Downloaded the starting files and installed the requiring dependencies using `npm install` command.
2. Created 4 components - `App`, `Header`, `Note` & `Footer` and edited them accordingly to render the corresponding elements in `ReactDOM`.
3. Rendered all the notes inside `src/notes.js` file dynamically as separate Note components.
4. Added an `InputArea` component inside `App` so that users can submit new notes.
5. Added a `DELETE` button inside each `Note` component so that users can click the to delete a particular note.
